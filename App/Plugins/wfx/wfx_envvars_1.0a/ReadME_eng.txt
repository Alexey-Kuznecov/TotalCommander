 Environment Variables Ex version 1.0 beta 3
=============================================

FS-plugin for Total Commander. Intended for viewing and editing environment
variables of current process (TC), current user and system.

Made as a replacement for the Environment Variables plugin, but with following
differences:

- Fixed bug which makes editing impossible if a variable has a long value
  (such as PATH).
- Environment Variables Ex is entirely unicode and exists in x64.
- Added support of file operations on variables like on usual files: copy in and
  out of plugin, move, rename. Files putting into plugin can be in ANSI or
  Unicode encoding.
- Added custom columns support to show variables values in separate column
  without modifications.
- Added elevation dialog to change system variables.
